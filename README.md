Performance Portable Opacity and Emissivity for simulation codes

## Components

- `eos` contains the analytic and tabular equation of state infrastructure
- `eospac-wrapper` is a wrapper for eospac
- `closure` contains mixed cell closure models. Currently pressure-temperature equilibrium is supported. Requires `eos`.
- `sesame2spiner` converts sesame tables to spiner tables
- `stellarcollaspe2spienr` converts tables found on stellarcollapse.org to spiner tables

## API

singularity-opac provides a uniform API for all opacity models. The following functions are provided
(here, `\sigma` is the frequency- and angle-dependent cross section in units of `cm^2`):
| Function              | Expression | Description            | Units   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------  | ------- |
| AbsorptionCoefficient | `n \sigma` | Absorption coefficient | `cm^{-1}` |
| AngleAveragedAbsorptionCoefficient | `\frac{1}{4 \pi}\int d\Omega n \sigma` |Absorption coefficient averaged over solid angle | `cm^{-1}` |
| EmissivityPerNuOmega | `j_{\nu} = \frac{dE}{d^3x dt d\Omega d\nu}` | Frequency- and angle-dependent emissivity | $erg cm^{-3} s^{-1} Sr^{-1} Hz^{-1}$ |
| EmissivityPerNu | `\int j_{\nu} d\nu`  | Frequency-dependent emissivity | `erg cm^{-3} s^{-1} Sr^{-1}` |
| Emissivity | `\int j_{\nu} d\nu d\Omega`  | Total emissivity | `erg cm^{-3} s^{-1}` |

Note that the thermal radiation energy density `u = 1/c ThermalDistributionOfT` and the thermal radiation number density `n = 1/c ThermalNumberDistribution`.


## To Build

At its most basic:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lanl/singularity-eos.git
cd singularity-eos
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make
```

### To Make tests

Then, in the singularity-eos root directory:
```bash
mkdir -p bin
cd bin
cmake -DSINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make -j
make test
```

### Build Options

A number of options are avaialable for compiling:

| Option                            | Default | Comment                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS           | OFF     | Build test infrastructure.                                                           |

## Units

singularity-eos, prior to unit modifiers, always uses CGS units internally. For
concreteness, the internal units of each quantity are:

| Quantity                  | Alternate names      | Units         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Mass density              | rho                  | g cm^-3       |
| Temperature               | temperature          | K             |
| Specific Internal Energy  | sie, Internal Energy | erg g^-1      |
| Pressure                  |                      | erg cm^-3     |
| Specific Heat             |                      | erg g^-1 K^-1 |
| Bulk Modulus              |                      | erg cm^-3     |
| Gruneisen Parameter       |                      |               |
