Performance Portable Opacity and Emissivity for simulation codes

## Components

- `eos` contains the analytic and tabular equation of state infrastructure
- `eospac-wrapper` is a wrapper for eospac
- `closure` contains mixed cell closure models. Currently pressure-temperature equilibrium is supported. Requires `eos`.
- `sesame2spiner` converts sesame tables to spiner tables
- `stellarcollaspe2spienr` converts tables found on stellarcollapse.org to spiner tables

## API

singularity-opac provides a uniform API for all opacity models. The following functions are provided
(here, $\sigma$ is the frequency- and angle-dependent cross section in units of $cm^2$):
| Function              | Expression | Description            | Units   |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------  | ------- |
| AbsorptionCoefficient | $n \sigma$ | Absorption coefficient | $cm^-1$ |


## To Build

At its most basic:
```bash
git clone --recursive git@github.com:lanl/singularity-eos.git
cd singularity-eos
mkdir bin
cd bin
cmake ..
make
```

### To Make tests

Then, in the singularity-eos root directory:
```bash
mkdir -p bin
cd bin
cmake -DSINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS=ON ..
make -j
make test
```

### Build Options

A number of options are avaialable for compiling:

| Option                            | Default | Comment                                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SINGULARITY_USE_HDF5              | ON      | Enables HDF5. Required for SpinerEOS, StellarCollapseEOS, and sesame2spiner          |
| SINGULARITY_USE_FORTRAN           | ON      | Enable Fortran API for equation of state                                             |
| SINGULARITY_USE_KOKKOS            | OFF     | Uses Kokkos as the portability backend. Currently only Kokkos is supported for GPUs. |
| SINGULARITY_USE_EOSPAC            | OFF     | Link against EOSPAC. Needed for sesame2spiner and some tests.                        |
| SINGULARITY_USE_CUDA              | OFF     | Target nvidia GPUs via cuda. Currently requires Kokkos.                              |
| SINGULARITY_USE_KOKKOSKERNELS     | OFF     | Use Kokkos Kernels for linear algebra. Needed for mixed cell closure models on GPU   |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_CLOSURE         | ON      | Builds mixed cell closure machinery for multi-material problems                      |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_TESTS           | OFF     | Build test infrastructure.                                                           |
| SINGULARITY_TEST_SESAME           | OFF     | Test the Sesame table readers                                                        |
| SINGULARITY_TEST_STELLAR_COLLAPSE | OFF     | Test the Stellar Collapse table readers                                              |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_SESAME2SPINER   | OFF     | Builds the conversion tool sesame2spiner which makes files readable by SpinerEOS     |
| SINGULARITY_BUILD_STELLARCOLLAPSE2SPINER | OFF     | Builds the conversion tool stellarcollapse2spiner which optionally makes stellar collapse files faster to read |
| SINGULARITY_INVERT_AT_SETUP       | OFF     | For tests, pre-invert eospac tables.                                                 |
| SINGULARITY_BETTER_DEBUG_FLAGS    | ON      | Enables nicer GPU debug flags. May interfere with in-tree builds as a submodule      |
| SINGULARITY_HIDE_MORE_WARNINGS    | OFF     | Makes warnings less verbose. May interfere with in-tree builds as a submodule        |
| SINGULARITY_SUBMODULE_MODE        | OFF     | Sets cmake flags for in-tree builds                                                  |

## Units

singularity-eos, prior to unit modifiers, always uses CGS units internally. For
concreteness, the internal units of each quantity are:

| Quantity                  | Alternate names      | Units         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| Mass density              | rho                  | g cm^-3       |
| Temperature               | temperature          | K             |
| Specific Internal Energy  | sie, Internal Energy | erg g^-1      |
| Pressure                  |                      | erg cm^-3     |
| Specific Heat             |                      | erg g^-1 K^-1 |
| Bulk Modulus              |                      | erg cm^-3     |
| Gruneisen Parameter       |                      |               |
